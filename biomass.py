This app calculates the potential biomass produced from processing palm oil fresh fruit bunches (FFB) and estimates the additional biomass generated from oil palm fronds (OPF) and trunks (OPT) based on plantation area in hectares. Biomass by-products, such as Empty Fruit Bunches (EFB), Palm Kernel Shell (PKS), Mesocarp Fibre, Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME), as well as OPF and OPT, play crucial roles in a circular economy. They contribute to sustainable energy production, soil enrichment, animal feed, and even wood-based materials, maximizing resource use and minimizing waste in the palm oil industry.
